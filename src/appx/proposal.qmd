Title: Acoustic Characteristics of Top Billboard Songs
By: Ava Ortiz, Yu Yan, Jay Mirman, Martha Miller

We will be exploring features of songs that make the top 100 Billboards. Looking at trends for the specific areas that tend to do well on the chart.

We chose this project because of the popularity of Spotify for our generation and our interest in learning about acoustic characteristics of songs.
