The article talks about effective teamwork is essential in today's work environments, whether remote or in-office. When people working together, they achieve more than they could on their own. Good teamwork starts with having a shared goal and making sure everyone feels included and valued. People bring different skills, experiences, and ideas, and that diversity is what makes teams stronger. Leaders should make sure everyone understands not just what the goal is, but how to reach it. A strong teamwork culture is built on trust, open communication, and make sure people feel safe to speak up.
