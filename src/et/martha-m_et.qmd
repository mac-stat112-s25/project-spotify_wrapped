Effective Teamwork

In the article *"The Secrets of Great Teamwork"* by Martine Haas and Mark Mortensen, published in the Harvard Business Review, the authors explore what makes modern teams effective in a constantly shifting work environment. The article highlights four key enabling conditions for team success:

1.**Compelling Direction** – Teams need clear, engaging goals that are challenging yet attainable.

2. **Strong Structure** – Diversity in skillset, defined roles, and appropriate team size contribute to productivity.

3. **Supportive Context** – Access to resources, training, and reward systems motivates teams to perform better.

4. **Shared Mindset** – Developing trust and a sense of unity, especially among remote or global teams, ensures alignment and smoother collaboration.

The article emphasizes that while technology and global connectivity have changed how teams operate, foundational teamwork principles still apply. Teams thrive when leadership fosters clarity, communication, and cohesion.
