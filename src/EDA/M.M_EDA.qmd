Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


In this project, we explore the **acoustic characteristics of songs that reach the Billboard Hot 100**, focusing on what makes certain tracks rise to the top. Using data from **Billboard chart rankings** and **Spotify audio features**, our goal is to analyze patterns in the types of songs that perform well commercially.

We were inspired to pursue this topic because of Spotify's massive popularity with our generation. The platform's audio data provides an excellent way to understand the sonic traits that may influence a song’s success on the charts.

### Datasets Used

- **Billboard Hot 100** (`billboard.csv`)  
  Contains weekly chart data for over 327,000 song entries, including:
  - `week_position` (chart rank)
  - `peak_position` (best chart rank)
  - `weeks_on_chart` (total duration on chart)
  - `song_id`, `song`, and `performer` identifiers

- **Spotify Audio Features** (`audio_features.csv`)  
  Contains audio metrics for ~29,500 songs, such as:
  - `danceability`, `energy`, `valence` (mood and vibe)
  - `tempo`, `loudness`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`
  - `spotify_track_popularity` (Spotify's internal score)

### Our Analytical Focus

We plan to merge these two datasets using `song_id`, then analyze how Spotify's audio features correlate with chart success. Our key research questions include:

- What sonic traits are most common among Top 10 Billboard songs?
- Have these traits changed over time (e.g. 1990s vs. 2010s)?
- Are certain genres or moods (e.g. high energy, low acousticness) more likely to chart higher?

We’re particularly interested in identifying whether there’s a "formula" for chart success — or whether it's more about industry trends, artist fame, or randomness.
