    "text": "This article mainly discussed the skills and methods of leadership in a group, but also touched on methods of facilitating good group work and progress. These methods were primarily clear communication, recognizing the emotions (particularly frustration) that may come up during a team project, and ensuring that each member gets to contribute in some way to the product. This article also mentioned some specific examples for difficulties that may arise and the ways to address them. One of these examples was frustration that may arise due to not reaching a consensus. To reach a consensus in the first place, it is suggested to set time limits on the discussion and make sure a consensus is reached by the end of the time. They also mention that if a consensus is reached very quickly, it is good to probe each team member individually and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the decision reached.\nThe link to the article can be found below:\nhttps://hr.berkeley.edu/hr-network/central-guide-managing-hr/managing-hr/interaction/team-building/steps",

    "text": "Effective Teamwork\nIn the article “The Secrets of Great Teamwork” by Martine Haas and Mark Mortensen, published in the Harvard Business Review, the authors explore what makes modern teams effective in a constantly shifting work environment. The article highlights four key enabling conditions for team success:\n1.Compelling Direction – Teams need clear, engaging goals that are challenging yet attainable.\n\nStrong Structure – Diversity in skillset, defined roles, and appropriate team size contribute to productivity.\nSupportive Context – Access to resources, training, and reward systems motivates teams to perform better.\nShared Mindset – Developing trust and a sense of unity, especially among remote or global teams, ensures alignment and smoother collaboration.\n\nThe article emphasizes that while technology and global connectivity have changed how teams operate, foundational teamwork principles still apply. Teams thrive when leadership fosters clarity, communication, and cohesion.\nThe Secrets of Great Teamwork - Harvard Business Review",

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nIn this project, we explore the acoustic characteristics of songs that reach the Billboard Hot 100, focusing on what makes certain tracks rise to the top. Using data from Billboard chart rankings and Spotify audio features, our goal is to analyze patterns in the types of songs that perform well commercially.\nWe were inspired to pursue this topic because of Spotify’s massive popularity with our generation. The platform’s audio data provides an excellent way to understand the sonic traits that may influence a song’s success on the charts.\n\n7.0.1 Datasets Used\n\nBillboard Hot 100 (billboard.csv)\nContains weekly chart data for over 327,000 song entries, including:\n\nweek_position (chart rank)\npeak_position (best chart rank)\nweeks_on_chart (total duration on chart)\nsong_id, song, and performer identifiers\n\nSpotify Audio Features (audio_features.csv)\nContains audio metrics for ~29,500 songs, such as:\n\ndanceability, energy, valence (mood and vibe)\ntempo, loudness, speechiness, acousticness\nspotify_track_popularity (Spotify’s internal score)\n\n\n\n\n7.0.2 Our Analytical Focus\nWe plan to merge these two datasets using song_id, then analyze how Spotify’s audio features correlate with chart success. Our key research questions include:\n\nWhat sonic traits are most common among Top 10 Billboard songs?\nHave these traits changed over time (e.g. 1990s vs. 2010s)?\nAre certain genres or moods (e.g. high energy, low acousticness) more likely to chart higher?\n\nWe’re particularly interested in identifying whether there’s a “formula” for chart success — or whether it’s more about industry trends, artist fame, or randomness.",
